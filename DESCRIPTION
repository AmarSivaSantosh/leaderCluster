Description: The leader clustering algorithm provides
 a means for clustering a set of data points. Unlike other algorithms
 it does not require the user to specify the number of clusters,
 but instead requires the approximate radius of a cluster as its
 primary tuning parameter. The package provides a fast implementation
 of this algorithm in n-dimensions using Lp-distances, or in spatial
 data over two dimensions using the Haversine formula, which takes
 latitude and longitude as inputs.
